## Version 0.1

### All mods to up to day 10 have been added, with the following exceptions:

* Mystic Spy - seems to have some weird issue with causing an "Exception in server tick loop" crash.
* TFC - Overrides default worldgen, and the og packdev notes that it causes fluidstack crashes.
   * If the latter can be fixed, TFC worldgen could prehaps be readded as an AR planet
* Sex mod - Currently can't add it to manifest, as there is no site I can pull it from.
   * As far as I know, the only ways to add a mod to a manifest is if they are on curse or github.
   * Also, og packdev notes that he wants to have sex automation be a part of the pack, but there is a lack of a config or modtweaker support to allow this to be possible.
     * Be the change you want to see :trollface:
* Orespawn - og packdev notes that it caused conflicts, also it shares manifest issues with sex mod

### Misc

The following mods have been swapped out.
* Extended crafting - replaced in favor of the omnifactory fork.
* Lucky blocks - replaced in favor of chance cubes, as there is no 1.12 version of lucky blocks on forge.
